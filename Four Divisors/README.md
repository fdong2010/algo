## Four Divisors

Given an integer array nums, return the sum of divisors of the integers in that array that have exactly four divisors. If there is no such integer in the array, return 0.

 

## Example 1:

Input: nums = [21,4,7]
Output: 32
Explanation: 
21 has 4 divisors: 1, 3, 7, 21
4 has 3 divisors: 1, 2, 4
7 has 2 divisors: 1, 7
The answer is the sum of divisors of 21 only.
## Example 2:

Input: nums = [21,21]
Output: 64
## Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
 

## Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 105


## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
